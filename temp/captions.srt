1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,267
Hey parents!

2
00:00:01,267 --> 00:00:03,294
Struggling with teaching your

3
00:00:03,294 --> 00:00:05,322
child the word 'drink'?

4
00:00:05,322 --> 00:00:06,969
Here's the game-changer.

5
00:00:06,969 --> 00:00:08,553
First, model the word

6
00:00:08,553 --> 00:00:10,960
before every drinking opportunity.

7
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,861
Say 'drink' clearly while

8
00:00:12,861 --> 00:00:14,635
holding their cup.

9
00:00:14,635 --> 00:00:16,156
Wait for any response

10
00:00:16,156 --> 00:00:17,233
- a sound,

11
00:00:17,233 --> 00:00:19,704
gesture, or word attempt.

12
00:00:19,704 --> 00:00:22,111
Immediately reward their effort!

13
00:00:22,111 --> 00:00:23,949
Do this during snacks,

14
00:00:23,949 --> 00:00:25,533
meals, and water breaks

15
00:00:25,533 --> 00:00:27,180
throughout the day.

16
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,194
The key?

17
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:30,094
Consistency and patience.

18
00:00:30,094 --> 00:00:31,868
More practice means faster

19
00:00:31,868 --> 00:00:34,276
learning. What's your biggest

20
00:00:34,276 --> 00:00:36,303
challenge with new words?
